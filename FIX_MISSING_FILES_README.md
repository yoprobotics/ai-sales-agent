# üêõ Fix Missing Hooks and Components

## Problem
The build was failing with TypeScript error:
```
Type error: File '/vercel/path0/apps/web/src/hooks/use-i18n.ts' is not a module.
```

The dashboard overview component was importing several files that didn't exist.

## Solution
Created all missing files required by the dashboard:

### Hooks
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-i18n.ts` - Internationalization hook for FR/EN support

### UI Components  
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - Badge component for status indicators
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Button component with variants

### Dashboard Components
- `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/recent-activity.tsx` - Activity feed widget
- `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/prospect-chart.tsx` - Chart visualization placeholder
- `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/performance-metrics.tsx` - Key metrics display
- `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/ai-insights.tsx` - AI-generated insights widget

### Core Package Utils
- `packages/core/src/utils/format.ts` - Number, percentage, currency formatting
- `packages/core/src/utils/validation.ts` - Email, URL, phone validation
- `packages/core/src/utils/string.ts` - String manipulation utilities
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` - Updated exports

### Lib Utils
- `apps/web/src/lib/utils.ts` - Common utilities (cn, formatRelativeTime, etc.)

### Dependencies
- Added `@radix-ui/react-slot` to package.json for Button component

## Files Created/Modified
- 12 new files created
- 2 files modified (package.json, core/index.ts)

## Testing
- All TypeScript imports now resolve correctly
- Components have proper types and exports
- Utility functions are properly exported from core package
- Build should now succeed without import errors

## Notes
- Components are functional placeholders with mock data
- Will need to connect to real APIs in next phase
- i18n is simplified for MVP (can upgrade to next-i18next later)
- Charts use placeholder SVG (can add recharts later)

# üêõ Fix Vercel Build Errors

## Problem Fixed
The build was failing with the following errors:
1. **Session upsert error**: Trying to use `userId` as unique field when it's not unique
2. **Missing AuditLog model**: Referenced in code but not in Prisma schema
3. **Missing Session fields**: `ipAddress` and `userAgent` were not in the schema

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Session Management (`apps/web/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)
- Changed from `upsert` to `deleteMany` + `create` pattern
- This ensures only one active session per user
- Prevents TypeScript errors about unique constraints

### 2. Updated Prisma Schema (`apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `AuditLog` model for compliance and security tracking
- Added missing fields to `Session` model:
  - `ipAddress`: Track user IP for security
  - `userAgent`: Track browser/device info
  - `updatedAt`: Track last session update
- Added proper indexes for performance

### 3. Created Database Migration
- Added migration file to apply schema changes
- Includes proper indexes for query performance
- Uses IF NOT EXISTS to prevent errors on re-run

## Testing Instructions
1. Pull this branch
2. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date
3. Run `npx prisma generate` to regenerate the Prisma client
4. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply the migration (for local testing)
5. Build the project: `npm run build`
6. The build should now succeed without errors

## Deployment Notes
- Vercel will automatically run `prisma generate` during build
- The migration will need to be applied to the production database
- No breaking changes - only additions to the schema

## Security Improvements
- Added audit logging for all authentication events
- Track IP addresses and user agents for sessions
- Better compliance with GDPR/PIPEDA/CCPA requirements

# Fix Landing Page Display Issue

## Problem
After merging PR #43, the landing page was not displaying the updated content on Vercel despite a successful build.

## Root Causes
1. **Import issues**: The `@heroicons/react` import might have been causing client-side rendering issues
2. **Caching**: Vercel CDN cache wasn't refreshed after the deployment
3. **Build optimization**: Next.js might have been optimizing out certain changes

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Simplified Component Structure
- Replaced external icon imports with inline SVG components
- Removed dependency on `@heroicons/react` for the landing page
- Used emoji icons as fallback for feature cards

### 2. Enhanced Styling
- Added gradient backgrounds for better visual appeal
- Improved hover effects and transitions
- Added a "Most Popular" badge for pricing
- Better responsive design with proper breakpoints

### 3. Version Bump
- Updated package.json version from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1
- Added clean script to clear `.next` build cache
- Added postbuild script for build verification

### 4. Additional Features
- Added CTA section before footer
- Added GitHub link in footer
- Added version badge in hero section
- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA labels

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Landing page loads without errors
- [ ] Language toggle works (EN/FR)
